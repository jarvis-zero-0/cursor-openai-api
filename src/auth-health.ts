/**
 * Tracks consecutive stale-auth ("auth-wedge") completion failures and recovers
 * the only way that works: by exiting the process so launchd `KeepAlive`
 * relaunches it with a fresh Cursor auth session.
 *
 * Why a process exit rather than in-process self-heal: a wedged auth session is
 * held by the long-lived SDK transport, so evicting and recreating an `Agent`
 * reuses the same poisoned session and keeps failing (observed as an endless
 * self-heal loop in the proxy log). A fresh process re-authenticates with the
 * same valid `CURSOR_API_KEY` and recovers. KeepAlive restarts are silent and
 * fast (seconds), so this also stops the watchdog's "wedged + auto-restarted"
 * alert for this failure class.
 *
 * A threshold guards against exiting on a single transient blip, and any
 * successful turn resets the streak.
