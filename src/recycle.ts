/**
 * Proactive pre-expiry recycle.
 *
 * Why this exists: the Cursor access token the long-lived proxy derives from
 * `CURSOR_API_KEY` expires roughly hourly, and the SDK does not refresh it
 * in-process. Once it lapses every completion fails with `[unauthenticated]`
 * until the *process* restarts (the auth-wedge failure class — see
 * `auth-health.ts`). `auth-health` is the reactive backstop (exit *after* a
 * wedge is observed); this controller is the proactive complement: it exits
 * cleanly a bit BEFORE the expiry window so launchd `KeepAlive` relaunches with
 * a fresh token and a live turn never hits an expired one.
 *
 * It drains first: when the uptime deadline is reached it waits for in-flight
 * turns to finish before exiting, so no streaming request is cut off. A grace
 * window bounds that wait so a single stuck turn can't pin a soon-to-be-stale
 * process open indefinitely.
 *
 * Exit code 0 — a clean, intended recycle, not a crash. `KeepAlive=true`
 * restarts the job regardless of exit code.
